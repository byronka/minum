Testing
=======

This code is to enable a minimal testing framework.  If you follow the conventions
from the tests that use it, you can gain nearly all the real value of testing.  What
it does not provide is the same level of reporting and multitude of functionality of
other well-known testing frameworks.  But, all that extra is not necessary for 
very high-quality testing.
