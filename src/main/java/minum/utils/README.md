Utilities
=========

There are a multitude of miscellaneous utilities here.

Just a few:

- ActionQueue: a thread-safe processing queue.  Pop something in the hopper and it will eventually get done.
- ByteUtils: manipulate bytes
- Invariants: code that makes strong assertions in the production code of correctness.
