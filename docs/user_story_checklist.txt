User story checklist:

The following is used during story development as a reminder to the development team
what is needed for high-quality software.

[ ] risks carefully considered

functional development and considerations
    documented thoughtfully
        [ ] classes
        [ ] methods
        [ ] tests
        [ ] unusual aspects documented within code
        [ ] READMEs
        [ ] developer documentation
        [ ] user documentation
        [ ] log entries added
    correctness
        [ ] unit tests written
        [ ] were the tests thorough, or only superficial?
        [ ] invariants applied - e.g. check(val > 10)
        [ ] integration tests written

non-functionals:
    [ ] perf (what parts might be slow? Is it possible to create a low-level test?)
    [ ] security (might use a tool like Zap to walk through the system)
    [ ] accessibility
    [ ] atqa.logging
    [ ] graceful degradation
    [ ] mobile-first

white-box testing:
    [ ] static analysis considered
    [ ] should it be refactored?

rendered text is highly correct:
     [ ] rendered HTML is valid (through a tool like W3C's https://validator.w3.org/)
     [ ] dynamic parts are cleaned, e.g. using code like safeAttr(), safeHTML()
     [ ] CSS is valid (using a tool like W3C https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ )
