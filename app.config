# The log levels are:

# Related to the business purposes of the application.  That is,
# the very highest-level, perhaps least-common logging messages.
# AUDIT
#
# Information useful for debugging.
# DEBUG
#
#
# Represents an error that occurs in a separate thread, so
# that we are not able to catch it bubbling up
# ASYNC_ERROR
#
#
# Information marked as trace is pretty much entered for
# the same reason as DEBUG - i.e. so we can see important
# information about the running state of the program. The
# only difference is that trace information is very voluminous.
# That is, there's tons of it, and it could make it harder
# to find the important information amongst a lot of noise.
# For that reason, TRACE is usually turned off.
